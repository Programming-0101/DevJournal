# Dan's Dev Journal

This is my personal developer journal. I'm partly doing it as an experiment with GitHub pages, dated blog posts, & GitHub's default theming.

## Bare-Bones Publishing

The wonderful folks at GitHub have made GitHub page publishing as ["easy as 1-2-3"](https://github.blog/2016-12-09-publishing-with-github-pages-now-as-easy-as-1-2-3/). Part of what that means is that, if you want, your repository doesn't need *any* Jekyll files or templates - you can keep your repository "pure", free of everything but your raw content.

Of course, that will also mean a bare-bones markdown repository published this way will be "plain" in its appearance and functionality. Still, for those without the time, energy or inclination to focus on anything but the content of their repository, this is welcome news. After all, **Content is King**.
