# Dan's Dev Journal

This is my personal developer journal. I'm partly doing it as an experiment with GitHub pages, dated blog posts, & GitHub's default theming.

## Bare-Bones Publishing

The wonderful folks at GitHub have made GitHub page publishing as ["easy as 1-2-3"](https://github.blog/2016-12-09-publishing-with-github-pages-now-as-easy-as-1-2-3/). Part of what that means is that, if you want, your repository doesn't need *any* Jekyll files or templates - you can keep your repository "pure", free of everything but your raw content.

Of course, that will also mean a bare-bones markdown repository published this way will be "plain" in its appearance and functionality. Still, for those without the time, energy or inclination to focus on anything but the content of their repository, this is welcome news. After all, **Content is King**.

## Focusing on Content

With a GitHub Pages site, you write your content in something called "Markdown". I won't attempt to get into the details of how to write content in markdown - there are plenty of sites that teach that. The main point is that you are focusing on generating **content**: thoughts, ideas, articles, notes-to-self, whatever. Markdown content is largely "word-focused", and is different from generating visual or interactive content, and it is this word-focused content that I'm talking about here. Generating this kind of content involves the art of expression, the work of creativity, and a commitment to investing time and energy. In other words, creating content is hard.

And yet, it's content that people crave.

When it comes to using our words, spoken or written, it's a good idea to follow the "THINK" principle: Before you speak/publish, check to see if it's **T**rue, **H**elpful, **I**nspiring, **N**ecessary, and **K**ind. I can't remember exactly where I first heard that, but certainly good advice. My thoughts on this site are software-developer-centric, but I hope to stay aligned with these principles. Enjoy!

## Linking to Pages

You can link to pages either through direct markdown links or through using some Jekyll scripting in your pages. See my [Articles](Articles.md) page for details.
