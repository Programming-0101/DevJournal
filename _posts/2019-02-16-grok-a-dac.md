# Grok-a-DAC

I'm working on a project where we've got to have some kind of Dev-Ops plan for the database portion of our application. I've thought in general terms about this before, but have never gotten around to actually learning about how to do it. I'm primarily a C# coder and, though capable in SQL, I've never taken the plunge into how to do it. So it's time to learn, and my target is **Data-Tier Applications** (*DAC*).

- [Data-tier Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/data-tier-applications/data-tier-applications?view=sql-server-2017) - Must-read to get a good overview of both DacPac and BacPac.
- [DacFx: What is it, why should you care and what you can use it for](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/New-Zealand-2016/M404) by Hannah Gray (Channel9 video) - **Awesome** video, as it gets right into blending my C# world with the DACFx API.
